# Replicated Cluster CloudFormation Demo
   
Implements a CloudFormation template the manages a Replicated installation
using the Embedded Cluster and a new license specific to the cluster.

Architecture
------------

This repo is designed to support shipping a product with the AWS Marketplace.
The overall architecture includes components that exist in the vendor account,
marketplace artifacts, and eventual delivered infrastructure/software in the
end customer account.

Details
-------

Uses Terraform and Python to implement a CloudFormation template that manages
a Replicated customer and an instance of your application running with the
Replicated Embedded Cluster. This is the foundation for creating an AWS
Marketplace product that is distributed with Replicated. The cluster created
is a single node based a [AMI including the Replicated Embedded Cluster binary
for the application](https://github.com/crdant/embedded-cluster-ami).

The license is handled as a custom resource in CloudFormation. It uses
the Replicated customer ID as the resource ID to facilitate managing the
lifecycle of the customer entirely within CloudFormation. The template
invokes a lambda function to manage the custom resource.

The lambda function is written in Python and is invoked via an SNS topic to
allow it to run in the software vendor's AWS account. Their is a class
`Customer` that manages the customer and uses the [Replicated Vendor Portal
API](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference) to create, load, and
delete customers. Update is not yet implemented.

The CloudFormation template is stored in an S3 bucket so it's available
for creating new stacks. The S3 bucket and the lambda function are both
managed with Terraform, along with a role and policy for the stack
execution.

This template has been used to publish [SlackerNews](https://slackernews.io)
as an AWS Marketplace product. To use it for your own product, you will need
to [create an AMI for your application](https://github.com/crdant/embedded-cluster-ami), fill out
the product load from on the [AWS Marketplace Management
Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/products/?), provide an
architecture diagram, then submit the product for review. 

There are a few things you need to be sure of when
submitting the product load form:

1. You must disclose that you are collecting customer information in the
   description or usage instructions. You should disclose that you collect
   their email and that is used for licensing and support purposes. You should
   also disclose the [telemetry collected by Replicated on your
   behalf](https://docs.replicated.com/vendor/instance-insights-event-data).
2. Since the CloudFormation template creates IAM roles and policies, you must
   also disclose that in your product description or usage instructions.

I have included the [product load form for
SlackerNews](marketplace/Slackernews%20AMI-CF%20Product%20-%20Rev%204.xlsx) and the
[architecture diagram](marketplace/architecture.svg) for you to adapt to your
application.

Usage
-----

Uses `make all` to create the necessary assets. It will prompt you for the id
for your application on the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com). If
you don't know it, you can find it with either `replicated app ls` or by going 
to the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) and looking at the 
settings for you application. Be sure to use the ID and not the slug.

You can then go to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and create
a CloudFormation stack using the deployed template. The template URL will be
in the Terraform output.
